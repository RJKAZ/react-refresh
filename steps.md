This is my notes for the 1st React Project GitHub Finder

This app will get refactored a few times

Step 1 - we create the broiler plate

npx create-react-app github-finder-1

If I was going to be putting this into an empty folder, I would just do npx create-react-app .

that " . " at the end will prevent the command from making a new folder and it will just install it in the current directory
