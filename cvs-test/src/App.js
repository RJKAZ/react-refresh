      <h1>Hello Yourself, since who but me will be seeing this page</h1>
      <p>
        The purpose of this challenge was to take JSON data stored as an API and
        fetch it to the browser
      </p>
      <p>
        The fetched data would be stored in the State (which I can't belieave I
        brain farted on)
      </p>
      <p>So on this page, the user names would be displayed</p>
      <p>
        and when you click on the name, it would go to a seperate page that
        would have all that users data
      </p>
      <p>How did I screw this up? Well...never again!</p>
    </div>

export default App;
